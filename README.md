# A Pytorch Implementation of Balanced Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Imbalanced Regression (ICCV 2025)

## Requirements
`conda env create -f environment.yml`


## Usage
We provide the code fir [AgeDB-DIR](https://github.com/manmanjun/BSAM_for_Imbalanced_Regression/tree/main/agedb) and [IMDB-WIKI-DIR](https://github.com/manmanjun/BSAM_for_Imbalanced_Regression/tree/main/imdb-wiki) dataset. Please go into the subfolders for more information.


## Checkpoints
